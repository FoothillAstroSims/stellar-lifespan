# stellar-lifespan

A calculator for stellar main sequence lifespans, allowing users to adjust stellar mass and luminosity (both relative to the sun).  This is a super-simplified approximation, treating the amount of core hydrogen as proportional to stellar mass.  In the "realistic" mode, it uses the M^4 relation for luminosity which is a reasonable approximation for a large range of stellar masses, but breaks down at low and high masses.
